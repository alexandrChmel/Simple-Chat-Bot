<h2>Printing data</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>When you write programs, you often need to print calculation results, text, or any other type of data. Also, throughout this educational platform, you will write a lot of programs that print data on the screen. Let's learn how to do that using a standard approach in Java.</p>

<p><strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a standard output is a receiver to which a program can send information in the form of text. | It is supported by all common operating systems and Java provides a special object, `System.out`, to work with the standard output. This object is often used to print data, with the `println()` method displaying the passed string followed by a new line on the screen. Standard output is a way for a program to write data to a destination, which can be a console, a file, or even a web socket. It is important to note that there are two types of streams: byte and character.">Standard output</a></strong> is a receiver to which a program can send information as text. It is supported by all common operating systems. Java provides a special <code class="language-java">System.out</code> object to work with the standard output. We will often use it to print data.</p>
<p>The <code class="language-java">println</code> method displays the passed string followed by a new line on the screen (<strong>print-line</strong>). For example, the following code snippet prints four lines.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println("I ");
System.out.println("know ");
System.out.println("Java ");
System.out.println("well.");
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the output we get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">I
know
Java
well.</code></pre>
<p>All the strings were printed as they are, without double quotes.</p>
<p>This method allows you to print an empty line when no string is given:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println("Java is a popular programming language.");
System.out.println(); // prints empty line
System.out.println("It is used all over the world!");</code></pre>
<p>And here is the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Java is a popular programming language.

It is used all over the world!</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-java">print</code> method displays the value that was passed in and places the cursor (the position where we display a value) after it. For example, the code below outputs all strings in a single line.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.print("I ");
System.out.print("know ");
System.out.print("Java ");
System.out.print("well.");
</code></pre>
<p>We receive the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">I know Java well.</code></pre>
<p>Pay attention to the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/17316" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a space in the context of strings refers to the incidental or essential whitespace characters present in a sequence of characters. | These whitespace characters can include trailing or leading spaces, and the Java compiler has a mechanism to handle them. When the compiler encounters a string, it determines the number of leading spaces that all lines have in common and then subtracts them from the string. Any additional leading spaces are left in the string, and trailing spaces are removed. The compiler then concatenates all the lines together to conform to the standard Java string type.">spaces</a> between words. We pass them to the method for printing.</p>

<p>4 letters<strong> sout</strong> and pressing the <strong>Tab</strong> key in the IntelliJ IDEA development environment will automatically write <code class="language-java">System.out.println()</code> for you</p>

<h5 id="printing-numbers-and-characters" style="text-align: center;">Printing numbers and characters</h5>
<p>Both <code class="language-java">println</code> and <code class="language-java">print</code> methods allow a program to print not only strings and characters, but also numbers.</p>
<p>Let's print two secret codes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.print(108);   // printing a number
System.out.print('c');   // printing a character that represents a letter
System.out.print("Q");   // printing a string
System.out.println('3'); // printing a character that represents a digit

System.out.print(22);
System.out.print('E');
System.out.print(8);
System.out.println('1');
</code></pre>
<p>Here is our output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">108cQ3
22E81</code></pre>
<p>As is the case with strings, none of the printed characters contain quotes.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In Java, you can print data via the standard output using the <code class="language-java">System.out</code> object. You can use the <code class="language-java">println</code> method to display the passed string in a print-line and the <code class="language-java">print</code> method to output all passed strings in a single line. Both of these methods also allow for printing numbers as well as characters. </p>
