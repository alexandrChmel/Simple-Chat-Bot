<p>In this topic, we will build our very first Java program. Our program will simply print <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> on the screen (a tradition by most programmers when learning new languages). Our code may not seem too exciting at first, however, we will learn about the basic template that all Java programs need to follow.</p>
<h5 id="the-hello-world-program">The Hello World program</h5>
<p>Here is the Java code of this program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
} </code></pre>
<p>You can type this code in the <strong>Your Code</strong> section <a href="https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> and then press the <strong>execute</strong> button. In the <strong>result</strong> section, you will see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Hello, World!</code></pre>
<p>If you have already installed Java, you can run the program on your computer. If not, there is no need to install it right now. We will do that later.</p>

<p>Now that you have seen<strong> </strong>the result, let's learn some basic terminology and then try to understand this program.</p>

A statement can take various forms, such as assignment statements, object creation statements, method invocation statements, or control flow statements.

A statement's execution order is determined by the program's control flow, which can be affected by blocks, loops, and other control structures.">statements</a>), which are executed one after another in a predictable manner.

<p>The <strong>Hello World</strong> program illustrates the basic elements of Java programs. For now, we will discuss only the most important elements.</p>
<p>1. <strong>The <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a public class is the fundamental unit of a Java program and serves as the entry point for execution. | Every Java program must have at least one public class, which must be named appropriately and cannot start with a digit. The public class can contain fields, methods, and constructors, which define the properties and behavior of objects created from the class. It's important to note that a public class can be accessed from other packages, making it visible and usable outside of its defining package. This is in contrast to a package-private class, which is only visible to other classes within the same package.">public class</a>.</strong> It is the basic unit of a program. Every Java program must have at least one class. The definition of a class consists of the <code class="language-java">class</code> keyword followed by the class name. A class can have any name, such as <code class="language-java">App</code>, <code class="language-java">Main</code>, or <code class="language-java">Program</code>, but it must not start with a digit. A set of braces <code class="language-java">{...}</code> encloses the body of a class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>The text after <code class="language-java">//</code> is just a comment, not a part of the program. We will learn about comments in detail in later topics.</p>
<p><strong>2. The <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the main method is a special method that serves as the entry point for any application and the starting point for program execution. | It is declared with the keyword public static void main(String[] args), where:

- public indicates that the method can be accessed from outside the class. - static means that the method can be called without creating an instance of the class. - void indicates that the method does not return any value. - main is the name of the method, which should always be the same. - String[] args represents a sequence of arguments passed to the program from the outside world. The main method must be contained within a class, and its name is predefined and case-sensitive.">main method</a>.</strong> To make the program runnable, we put a method named <code class="language-java">main</code> inside a class. It is the entry point for a Java program. Again, the braces <code class="language-java">{...}</code> enclose the body of the method, which contains programming statements.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args) {
    // statements go here
}</code></pre>
<p>The keywords <code class="language-java">public</code>, <code class="language-java">static</code>, and <code class="language-java">void</code> will be discussed later, so just remember them for now. The name of this method (<code class="language-java">main</code>) is predefined and should always be the same. Capitalization matters: if you name your first method <strong>Main</strong>, <strong>MAIN</strong> or something else, the program cannot start.</p>
<p>The element <code class="language-java">String[] args</code> represents a sequence of arguments passed to the program from the outside world. Don't worry about them right now.</p>
<p><strong>3. Printing "Hello, World!"</strong>. The body of the method consists of programming statements that determine what the program should do after starting. Our program prints the string <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> using the following statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println("Hello, World!"); //  each statement has to end with ;</code></pre>
<p>This is one of the most important things to understand from the <strong>Hello World</strong> program. We invoke a special method <code class="language-java">println</code> to display a string followed by a new line on the screen. We will often use this approach to print something of interest to the screen. The text is printed without double quotes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>It is important that <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> is not a keyword or an identifier; it is just some text to be printed.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="keywords">Keywords</h5>
<p><video controls="" src="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/265001/1080/2e79d94831cc6827b76dc28f2ca93db5.mp4"> Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can <a href="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/265001/1080/2e79d94831cc6827b76dc28f2ca93db5.mp4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download it</a> and watch it with your favorite video player! </video></p>
<p>As you can see, even a simple Java program consists of many elements, including <strong>keywords</strong> that are parts of the language. In total, Java provides more than 50 keywords which you will gradually learn on this platform. The full list is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_keywords" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, though you don't need to remember all of them at this moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Note,  <code class="language-java">main</code> is outside the given list because it is not a keyword.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>We have discussed the simplest program you can write in Java. It has a single class with a single <code class="language-java">main</code> method. Every Java program must have a <code class="language-java">main</code> method as it is the first to be executed when the program runs.<strong> </strong>Don't worry about memorizing every single term used in the topic (syntax, statement, block). These terms will reappear in further materials. Do not forget to use the provided <strong>Hello World</strong> program as a template in your own programs.</p>
