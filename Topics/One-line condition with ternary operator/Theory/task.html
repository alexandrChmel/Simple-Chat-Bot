<h2>One-line condition with ternary operator</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Quite often you may need to assign different values to a variable depending on a certain condition. You may do it conveniently with the help of the <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3506" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a ternary operator is a concise way to express simple conditional statements. | It provides a compact syntax to evaluate a boolean expression and choose one of two expressions to execute based on the boolean expression's outcome. The ternary operator consists of three operands: a boolean expression, and two expressions to be evaluated based on the boolean expression's outcome. It is important to note that the expressions following the boolean expression must be reducible to a common type.

Instead of writing lengthy <code class="language-java">if-else</code> constructs for basic conditions, you can use the ternary operator to achieve the same result in a more concise manner.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-ternary-operator">What is the ternary operator?</h5>
<p>The ternary operator is an operator which evaluates a condition and chooses one of two cases to execute. It is also called the <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3506" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a conditional operator, also known as the ternary operator, is a shorthand for the if-then-else statement. | It consists of a boolean expression followed by a question mark, then two expressions separated by a colon. The first expression is executed if the boolean expression is true, and the second expression is executed if the boolean expression is false. This operator can be used in place where an expression is expected and can be a more readable and concise alternative to the if statement.">conditional operator</a></strong>. The operator can be considered as a form of the <code class="language-java">if</code>-then-<code class="language-java">else</code> statement. The ternary operator should not be confused with the conditional statement, despite their similarity. This operator can be used in places where an expression is expected.</p>
<p>Sometimes <strong>the ternary operator</strong> is more readable and concise than the corresponding <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3506" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an if statement is a conditional statement used to control the flow of a program based on whether a specified boolean expression is true or false. | If the expression evaluates to true, the code block within the if statement is executed, otherwise, it is skipped. The if statement can be used in any place in a program where a statement is expected, and it can even be nested inside another conditional statement to perform multistage checks. The if statement is a fundamental control flow construct in Java, allowing for conditional execution of code based on specific conditions.">if statement</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Let's start learning this operator with an example. Suppose we have to find the maximum of two int variables, <code class="language-java">a</code> and <code class="language-java">b</code>. It is easy to write using a conditional statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int a = ...;
int b = ...;
int max = ...;

if (a &gt; b) {
    max = a;
} else {
    max = b;
}</code></pre>
<p>Here is what an equivalent ternary operator looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int max = a &gt; b ? a : b;</code></pre>
<p>This code is more concise than the code above, isn't it?</p>
<p>The general syntax of the ternary operator is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">result = condition ? trueCase : elseCase;</code></pre>
<p>It includes two special symbols <code class="language-java">?</code> and <code class="language-java">:</code>.</p>
<p>Here, the <code class="language-java">condition</code> is a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3506" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value, either true or false. | It is used to make decisions in a program based on whether a certain condition is met or not. Boolean expressions can be assigned to a boolean variable or used in control flow statements such as if-else and loop. They can be created using logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT, which allow you to join a sequence of relational operations into one expression. An example of a boolean expression is (x &gt; 5) &amp;&amp; (y &lt; 10), which evaluates to true if both conditions x is greater than 5 and y is less than 10 are met.">Boolean expression</a> that evaluates to either <code class="language-java">true</code> or <code class="language-java">false</code>. If this expression is <code class="language-java">true</code>, the ternary operator evaluates <code class="language-java">trueCase</code>, otherwise <code class="language-java">elseCase</code> is evaluated. It is important that <code class="language-java">trueCase</code> and <code class="language-java">elseCase</code> are expressions which can be reduced to a common type. This type determines the type of the <code class="language-java">result</code>.</p>
<h5 id="usage-example">Usage example</h5>
<p>Let's consider another example that prints whether a number is even or odd.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int num = ...;  // it's initialized by a value
System.out.println(num % 2 == 0 ? "even" : "odd");</code></pre>
<p>This ternary operator consists of three operands: the value of the expression <code class="language-java">num % 2 == 0</code>, and two string literals <code class="language-java">"even"</code> and <code class="language-java">"odd"</code>. Its result type is <code class="language-java">String</code>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note: Java allows us to nest one ternary operator into another one, but it can be less readable than the corresponding conditional statement. If you do this, be careful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Imagine you need to compare two integer numbers and print <code class="language-java">equal</code> in case they are equal, <code class="language-java">more</code> if the first one has a bigger value than the second and <code class="language-java">less</code> otherwise. The task can be solved using a combination of 2 ternary operators:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int a = ...; // it's initialized by a value
int b = ...; // it's initialized by a value
String result = a == b ? "equal" :
                a &gt; b ? "more" : "less";</code></pre>
<p>At first, the outer ternary operator checks equality of <code class="language-java">a</code> and <code class="language-java">b</code> numbers. If it is true, <code class="language-java">equal</code> is printed, otherwise, the nested ternary operator <code class="language-java">a &gt; b ? "more" : "less"</code> is calculated. To improve readability, the whole expression is divided into two lines.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>The ternary operator in Java is a concise way to evaluate a condition and assign values to a variable based on that condition. It is similar to an <code class="language-java">if-else</code> statement but can be more readable and concise in certain situations.
