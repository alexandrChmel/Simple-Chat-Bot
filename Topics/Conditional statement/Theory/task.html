Boolean expressions can be assigned to a boolean variable or used in control flow statements such as if-else and loop. They can be created using logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT, which allow you to join a sequence of relational operations into one expression. An example of a boolean expression is (x &gt; 5) &amp;&amp; (y &lt; 10), which evaluates to true if both conditions x is greater than 5 and y is less than 10 are met.">Boolean expression</a>. If it is <code class="language-java">true</code>, the program performs one computation; otherwise, if it is <code class="language-java">false</code>, the program performs another computation. Here are some examples of Boolean expressions:  <code class="language-java">a &gt; b</code>, <code class="language-java">i - j == 1</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>The conditional statement has different forms. We will use all of them.</p>
<h5 id="the-single-if-case">The single if-case</h5>
<p>The simplest form of the conditional statement consists of the keyword <code class="language-java">if</code>, a Boolean expression enclosed in parentheses, and a body enclosed in <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3503" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a curly brace is a symbol used to define the scope of a code block, such as a class, method, or control flow statement. | It is commonly used in pairs, with the opening brace appearing at the end of the line that introduces the code block, and the closing brace appearing on its own line, indented to match the level of indentation of the opening brace. Curly braces can also be used with quantifiers to specify a range of repetition for a preceding character or group in regular expressions. When using curly braces in this way, it is important to avoid using spaces inside the braces, as this can lead to unintended behavior.">curly braces</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (expression) {
    // body: do something
}</code></pre>
<p>If the expression is <code class="language-java">true</code>, the statements inside the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3503" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a code block is a group of statements that should be executed together. | Code blocks can be used to define methods, constructors, initializer blocks, and control structures such as loops and if-else statements. The statements within a block are executed sequentially, and any variable declared within the block is only accessible within that block. Code blocks are useful for organizing and controlling the flow of code in a Java program. They are also used to define the scope of variables and methods. In Java 15, text blocks were introduced as a new feature for handling long, multi-line strings in a more readable and visually appealing way.">code block</a> are executed; otherwise, the program skips them.</p>
<p>See the following example.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int age = ...; // it has a value
if (age &gt; 100) {
    System.out.println("Very experienced person");
}</code></pre>
<p>In this example, if the <code class="language-java">age</code> is greater than 100 the code prints <strong>"Very experienced person"</strong>, otherwise, it does nothing.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will see a situation where the expression in a condition is a single <code class="language-java">boolean</code> type variable. Instead of writing <code class="language-java">b == true</code> or <code class="language-java">b == false</code>, use this variable (or its negation with <code class="language-java">!</code>) as the Boolean expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">boolean b = ...; // it is true or false
if (b) { // or !b
    // do something
}</code></pre>
<p>A conditional statement can be used in any place in a program where the statement is expected. It can even be nested inside another conditional statement to perform multistage checks.</p>
<h5 id="the-if-else-cases">The if-else-cases</h5>
<p>The if-case above can be extended with the keyword <code class="language-java">else</code> and another body to do alternative actions when the expression is <code class="language-java">false</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (expression) {    
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
} </code></pre>
<p>In this case, if the expression is <code class="language-java">true</code>, then the first code block is executed; otherwise, the second code block is executed, but not both together.</p>
<p>In the example below,  the program outputs different text depending on the value of <code class="language-java">num</code> (even or odd).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p>Note: a number is even if it can be divided exactly by 2; otherwise it's odd.</p>
<p></p></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int num = ...; // the num is initialized by some value

if (num % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("It's an even number");
} else {    
    System.out.println("It's an odd number");
}</code></pre>
<p>Since a number can only be even or odd, only one message will be displayed. If <code class="language-java">num</code> is 10, the program outputs <code class="language-java">"It's an even number"</code>. If the value is 11, it outputs <code class="language-java">"It's an odd number"</code>.</p>
<h5 id="the-if-else-if-cases">The if-else-if-cases</h5>
<p>The most general form of the conditional statement consists of several conditions and <code class="language-java">else-if</code>-branches.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (expression0) {
    // do something
} else if (expression1) {
    // do something else 1
// ...
} else if (expressionN) {
    // do something else N
}</code></pre>
<p>The following code outputs recommendations about what computer you need to buy depending on your budget.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">long dollars = ...; // your budget

if (dollars &lt; 1000) {
    System.out.println("Buy a laptop");
} else if (dollars &lt; 2000) {
    System.out.println("Buy a personal computer");
} else if (dollars &lt; 100_000) {
    System.out.println("Buy a server");
} else {
    System.out.println("Buy a data center or a quantum computer");
}</code></pre>
<p>This conditional statement has four branches: <code class="language-java">dollars &lt; 1000</code>, <code class="language-java">dollars &lt; 2000</code>, <code class="language-java">dollars &lt; 100_000</code> and <code class="language-java">dollars &gt;= 100_000</code>. For example, if the value of <code class="language-java">dollars</code> is <code class="language-java">10_000</code>, it prints <code class="language-java">"Buy a server"</code> because <code class="language-java">10_000</code> is more than <code class="language-java">2000</code> , which means that the first and the second conditions are false, and less than <code class="language-java">100_000</code> , which means that the third condition is true.</p>
<p>A conditional statement with multiple branches creates a <strong>decision tree</strong>, whose nodes consist of boolean expressions, and each branch is marked with <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>. The <em>true</em>-branch leads to a block of statements to be executed and a <code class="language-java">false</code>-branch leads to the next condition to be checked. The last false-branch means <strong>"</strong><em>in all other cases</em><strong>"</strong>.</p>

<p>When talking about conditions, programmers often use the term "<a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3503" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, control flow refers to the order in which various parts of a program are executed. | It is often discussed in the context of control flow statements, which determine the order of execution based on certain conditions. For example, a loop is a control flow statement that allows for the repeated execution of a block of code a specified number of times. The while loop is a type of pre-test loop that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The loop's body can contain any valid Java statement, including conditional statements and even other loops (known as nested loops).">control flow</a> statements". <strong>Control flow</strong> is the order in which various parts of a program are executed.
