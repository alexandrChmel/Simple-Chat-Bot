<h2>Integer types and operations</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Java provides several types which represent integer numbers including positive, negative, and zero. In practice, the most used types are <code class="language-java">int</code> and <code class="language-java">long</code>. The first type can store numbers from a smaller range than the second one, but it is often enough (especially, in this topic). You can perform all <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/13511" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, arithmetic operations are mathematical calculations that can be performed using arithmetic operators. | These operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and modulus or remainder (%) operators. Arithmetic operations take two values or operands, with the exception of unary operators such as unary plus (+) and unary minus (-), which take a single value. The order of operation follows the standard arithmetic rules, with multiplication and division having a higher priority level than addition and subtraction. Parentheses can be used to specify the order of execution and for clarity. The unary plus operator indicates a positive value, while the unary minus operator negates a value or an expression.">arithmetic operations</a> (<code class="language-java">+</code>, <code class="language-java">-</code>, <code class="language-java">*</code>, <code class="language-java">/</code>, <code class="language-java">%</code>) with variables of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3565" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an integer type is a data type that represents whole numbers, including positive, negative, and zero. | The most commonly used integer types in Java are `int` and `long`. The `int` type can store numbers within a smaller range, while `long` can store a wider range of numbers. Integer types can be used in various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Java also allows the use of the special underscore character to improve the readability of numbers by separating groups of digits.">integer types</a>.</p>
<h5 id="integer-types-the-basics">Integer types: the basics</h5>
<p>Let's look at some examples below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int two = 2;
int ten = 10;

int twelve = two + ten; // 12
int eight = ten - two;  // 8
int twenty = two * ten; // 20
int five = ten / two;   // 5
int zero = ten % two;   // 0, no remainder

int minusTwo = -two; // -2
</code></pre>
<p>This code demonstrates how to assign values to int variables as well as how to perform arithmetic operations with them. </p>
<p>To improve the readability of your code, the special underscore character  <code class="language-java">_</code>  can be used to separate groups of digits within a number.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int million = 1_000_000;</code></pre>
<p>You may also print a value of an <code class="language-java">int</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their value can be accessed and modified using the name. It's important to note that variables can be changed, meaning you can assign a new value to a variable without having to declare it again.">variable</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int number = 100;
System.out.println(number); // 100</code></pre>
<p>All arithmetic operations work with the <code class="language-java">long</code> type as well.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">long one = 1L;
long twentyTwo = 22L; // L or l is a literal for longs
long bigNumber = 100_000_000_000L;

long result = bigNumber + twentyTwo - one; 
System.out.println(result); // 100000000021</code></pre>
<p>If a number ends with the letter <code class="language-java">L</code> or <code class="language-java">l</code>, it is considered as <code class="language-java">long</code>, otherwise, it is <code class="language-java">int</code>.</p>
<p>Look at the following examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int bigNumber = 5_000_000_000; //won't compile due to the value exceeding the maximum capacity of an int</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-java">long bigNumber = 5_000_000_000L; //compiles successfully</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>We recommend that you use the uppercase letter <code class="language-java">L</code> because the lower case letter <code class="language-java">l</code> is very similar to the digit <code class="language-java">1</code>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p></p><p>Use <code class="language-java">long</code> numbers only if it is really necessary (when you deal with numbers larger than two billion). In other situations, prefer <code class="language-java">int</code> numbers. </p><p></p></div>

<h5 id="the-forms-of-the-assignment-operator">The forms of the assignment operator</h5>
<p>Suppose you want to add some value to a variable. You may write something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int n = 10;
n = n + 4; // 14</code></pre>
<p>The <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3565" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an assignment operator is a symbol used to assign a value to a variable. | The most common assignment operator is the single equals sign (=), which assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left. For example, in the statement `int x = 10;`, the assignment operator is used to assign the value 10 to the variable x. It's important to note that the assignment operator should not be confused with the equality operator (==), which is used to test for equality between two expressions.">assignment operator</a> <code class="language-java">=</code> has several forms which combine it with an operation to avoid repeating the variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int n = 10;
n += 4; // 14</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, this form looks more concise. There are a few other possible forms such as <code class="language-java">*=</code>, <code class="language-java">/=</code>, <code class="language-java">%=</code>.</p>
<h5 id="reading-numbers-from-the-standard-input">Reading numbers from the standard input</h5>
<p>As a rule, to solve a problem you need to read some data from the outside world, process it, and output the result. The following program reads two numbers from the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3565" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the standard input is a default source of input for a program, which is typically associated with the keyboard. | It is a mechanism provided by the operating system for a program to consume data and can be redirected from a file or other sources. The standard input is commonly used in programming problems to read data, process it, and output the result to the standard output. It can be accessed in Java using the System.in class, which allows a program to read values of various types from the standard input.">standard input</a>, adds them, and prints the sum.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        int sum = a + b;

        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This simple code uses <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> to read data.</p>
<p>If we know that the input numbers can be quite large, we can read <code class="language-java">long</code>s instead of <code class="language-java">int</code>s:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">long a = scanner.nextLong();
long b = scanner.nextLong();

long sum = a + b;</code></pre>
<p>See? No more lines need to be changed in this code.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, you learned about using integer types <code class="language-java">int</code> and <code class="language-java">long</code> to perform various arithmetic operations. Now you have enough knowledge to write useful programs that process data. You may use the template above for solving this topic's code challenges. Try to give meaningful names to variables when solving problems.</p>
