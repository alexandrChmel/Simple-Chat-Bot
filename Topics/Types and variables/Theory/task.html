<p>Every variable has a <strong>name </strong>(also known as<strong> an identifier)</strong> to distinguish it from others. Before you start using a variable, you must declare it. The general form of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a declaration is a statement that introduces a variable, method, or class into the program. | It specifies the type of the entity being declared, its name, and other relevant information such as access modifiers, return type (for methods), and initial values (for variables). For example, the declaration of a method may include its name, return type, access modifier, and parameter list. Declarations are essential for Java to understand the structure and behavior of the program. Incorrect declarations can lead to compilation errors. Java 10 introduced type inference, which allows developers to use the var keyword instead of a specific type, and the type is automatically inferred based on the assigned value.">declaration</a> is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">DataType variableName = initialization;</code></pre>
<p>The left part of this <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a statement is a unit of code that performs a specific action. | It can be a standalone instruction or a part of a larger block of code. A statement can take various forms, such as assignment statements, object creation statements, method invocation statements, or control flow statements. Control flow statements, such as if-else statements or switch statements, allow for decision-making and conditional execution of code based on certain conditions. A statement's execution order is determined by the program's control flow, which can be affected by blocks, loops, and other control structures.">statement</a> describes the variable, and the right part describes something that is assigned to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>type (</strong>or<strong> data type) </strong>of a variable determines what possible operations can be performed on the variable and which values can be stored in it. Here we use a non-existent data type (<strong>DataType</strong>) to demonstrate the general form of declaration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>name (</strong>or<strong> identifier)</strong> distinguishes the variable from others. The name of a variable cannot start with a digit; it usually starts with a letter. Always try to choose meaningful and readable names for variables to make your code easy to understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>assignment</strong> <strong>operator</strong> denoted as <code class="language-java">=</code> is used to assign a single value or a result of an <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an expression is a construct that can be evaluated to a value. | This value can then be used in further computations or assigned to a variable. A lambda expression, specifically, is an anonymous function that can be assigned to a variable. Its general form consists of a list of parameters followed by the body of the function. The body can return a value. Lambda expressions are particularly useful when you want to pass a small function as a parameter to a method, or when you want to create a function on the fly, without having to define a separate method for it. Unlike a switch statement, which can update the value of a predefined variable, a switch expression evaluates to a specific value and is assigned to a variable.">expression</a> to a variable.</p>
</li>

<p>The<strong> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, initialization is the process of assigning an initial value to a variable or an object. | This can be done in several ways, such as through a constructor, an instance initialization block, or a static initialization block. The Java compiler also allows for automatic type inference during initialization, where the type is determined based on the assigned value. Initialization is an important concept in Java because it ensures that objects are properly set up before they are used in a program.">initialization</a></strong> is a value or a result of an expression that is assigned to the variable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to this declaration, we can declare a variable of the type <strong>String</strong> and assign the word <strong>"java"</strong> to it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String language = "java";</code></pre>
<p>We can also declare a variable of the type <code class="language-java">int</code> to store an integer number:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int numberOfApples = 5;</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>The case in the name of a variable makes a difference: <code class="language-java">language</code> is not the same as <code class="language-java">Language</code>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Variables can store not only strings and numbers, but also characters and other <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a data type is a category that determines the type of data a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. | Java has two groups of data types: primitive and reference types. Primitive data types are built-in and include eight types, such as int (integer number), float and double (fractional numbers), and boolean (true or false values). Reference types, on the other hand, are used to represent objects, and they are created using the keyword new. When a reference type is created, memory is allocated for the object, and it is called instantiation. Floating-point types, such as float and double, represent numbers that contain an integer part, a fractional part, and their separator, commonly used in fields such as science, statistics, and engineering.">data types</a> which we will learn about later in the next topics.</p>
<h5 id="accessing-the-value-of-a-variable">Accessing the value of a variable</h5>
<p>Once a variable has been declared, its value can be accessed and modified using the name. In the example below, we declare a variable and then print it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String dayOfWeek = "Monday";
System.out.println(dayOfWeek); // Monday</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to assign a value of one variable to another one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int one = 1;
int num = one;
System.out.println(num); // 1</code></pre>
<p>One important feature of variables is that they can be changed. You don't need to declare a variable again to change its value; just assign a new value to it using the <code class="language-java">=</code> operator.</p>
<p>Let's declare a variable named <code class="language-java">dayOfWeek</code> and print its value before and after changing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String dayOfWeek = "Monday";
System.out.println(dayOfWeek); // Monday

dayOfWeek = "Tuesday";
System.out.println(dayOfWeek); // Tuesday</code></pre>
<p>There is one restriction for variables: you can only assign a value of the same type as the type of the initial variable. So, the following code is not correct:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int number = 10;
number = 11; // ok
number = "twelve"; // it does not work!</code></pre>
<h5 id="alternative-forms-of-declaration">Alternative forms of declaration</h5>
<p>There are several alternative forms of declaration which are less commonly used in practice. Here are a couple of them shown with examples..</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Declaring several variables of the same type as a single statement:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">String language = "java", version = "8 or newer";</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Separating declaration and initialization into statements:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">int age; // declaration
age = 35; // initialization </code></pre>
<p>However, as we have already noted, these forms are rarely used.</p>
<h5 id="type-inference">Type inference</h5>
<p>Since Java 10, you can write <strong>var</strong> instead of a specific type to force automatic <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, type inference is a feature that allows the compiler to automatically deduce the data type of a variable, expression, or method based on the context in which it is used. | This feature was introduced in Java 7, and it became more powerful in Java 10 with the introduction of the diamond operator (&lt;&gt;) and pattern matching. With type inference, developers can write more concise and readable code by avoiding explicit type declarations.">type inference</a> based on the type of assigned value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">var variableName = initialization;</code></pre>
<p>Here are two examples below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">var language = "Java"; // String
var version = 10; // int</code></pre>
<p>This feature can be a bit controversial: on the one hand, it allows your code to be more concise. On the other hand, since it doesn't indicate the type explicitly, it may affect the code readability in a bad way. For now, it's enough to understand the basic idea. We will not use type inference in our theory so that our educational platform is suitable for people who use earlier versions of Java. But if you would like to practice it, you may use type inference in our exercises as they fully support Java 10.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Variables in Java are used to store values of different data types. They need to be declared with a type and a name. Variables can be modified after declaration, but the new value must be of the same type as the old one. In Java 10, the <strong>var</strong> keyword was introduced for automatic type inference.<br/><br/>
