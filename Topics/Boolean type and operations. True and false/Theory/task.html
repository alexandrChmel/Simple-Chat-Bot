<h2>Boolean type and operations. True and false</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>The <code class="language-java">boolean</code> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3516" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a data type is a category that determines the type of data a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. | Java has two groups of data types: primitive and reference types. Primitive data types are built-in and include eight types, such as int (integer number), float and double (fractional numbers), and boolean (true or false values). Reference types, on the other hand, are used to represent objects, and they are created using the keyword new. When a reference type is created, memory is allocated for the object, and it is called instantiation. Floating-point types, such as float and double, represent numbers that contain an integer part, a fractional part, and their separator, commonly used in fields such as science, statistics, and engineering.">data type</a> in Java is used to represent logical values, which can have only two possible states: <code class="language-java">true</code> and <code class="language-java">false</code>. It is used for creating conditions and logic in programs, allowing programmers to make decisions based on Boolean conditions. <br/><br/>
This data type is particularly useful for implementing logic related to binary states, such as on/off, yes/no, and similar situations.</p>

Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their value can be accessed and modified using the name. It's important to note that variables can be changed, meaning you can assign a new value to a variable without having to declare it again.">Variables</a> of the <code class="language-java">boolean</code> type are often used to build <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3516" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a logical expression is a combination of boolean expressions joined together using logical operators. | These operators include not (denoted by ! ), and (denoted by &amp;), or (denoted by ), and xor (denoted by ^).

<p>An interesting thing is that the <code class="language-java">&amp;&amp;</code> and <code class="language-java">||</code> operators don't evaluate the second argument if it isn't necessary. When the first argument of the <code class="language-java">&amp;&amp;</code> operator evaluates to <code class="language-java">false</code>, the overall value must be <code class="language-java">false</code>; and when the first argument of the <code class="language-java">||</code> operator evaluates to <code class="language-java">true</code>, the overall value must be <code class="language-java">true</code>. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code class="language-java">false &amp;&amp; ...</code> -&gt; <code class="language-java">false</code>, since it is not necessary to know what the right-hand side is;</p>

<p><code class="language-java">true || ...</code> -&gt; <code class="language-java">true</code>, since it is not necessary to know what the right-hand side is.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-java">boolean</code> data type has only two possible values: <code class="language-java">false</code> and <code class="language-java">true</code>, and is used to represent logical states.
